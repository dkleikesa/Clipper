 * Platforms report a code point for every key press, including presses that

 * — U+FFFF — for those, which is how a bare Shift press ended up inserting a
 * stray glyph at the caret (#220). U+FFFF is a Unicode *noncharacter*, not a
 * control character, so an `isISOControl()` guard alone lets it through.
 *
 * Rejected here:
 *  - anything outside the BMP, since the result is a single [Char] and a wider
 *    code point could only be delivered truncated (Android additionally packs
 *    flag bits above the BMP for dead keys, e.g. `COMBINING_ACCENT`);
 *  - surrogates, which are only meaningful as a pair and would leave an
 *    unpaired half in the document;
 *  - noncharacters — U+FDD0..U+FDEF and U+FFFE/U+FFFF — which are permanently
 *    reserved and never denote text;
 *  - ISO control characters, including U+0000, which callers handle as key
 *    bindings rather than as input.
 *
 * `Char.isDefined()` would cover the noncharacter case, but it also rejects
 * every code point merely *unassigned* in the platform's Unicode tables. Those
 * tables differ between Kotlin/JVM and Kotlin/Native and lag the standard, so
 * it would silently drop characters a user can legitimately type and would do
 * so differently per target. The structural classes above are fixed by the
 * standard, so testing them directly is both stable and portable.
