/**
 * Port of `matchdecorator.ts` — applies a decoration to every match of a
 * regular expression in the visible document range.
 *
 * @param regexp   The regular expression to match. Must have the `g` flag (or
 *                 Kotlin's `findAll` equivalent).
 * @param decorate Called for each match; returns a [Decoration] (or null to
 *                 skip this match).
 * @param boundary Optional positive-lookahead boundary (not used in Kotlin port).
 * @param maxLength Maximum characters to scan per viewport update. Defaults to
 *                  1 000 000 (effectively unbounded).
